As Secretary-General for this year's conference, she aims to work tirelessly to make this edition of CHIREC JMUN the best one yet. She looks forward to seeing you all there!",

      "Arnav Reddy Jakka is an IBDP year 1 student currently studying Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at a higher level. Judging by his academic selection you may think he's a serious person, but don't be mistaken.\n\nIf you're his friend be prepared to be sent the most random reels which only he finds funny. When he's not laughing at those, you'll probably see him laughing around youâ€¦ or maybe at you. But all jokes aside if he's ever quiet, it's probably because his mouth's full - as an avid foodie, he's always eating something. Just like in cricket, Jakka's an all-rounder in everything he does, managing to pull off sports, studies, and MUN with the same energy and dedication he brings to every match. That's exactly what makes him the perfect Secretary General for this year's conference.",
